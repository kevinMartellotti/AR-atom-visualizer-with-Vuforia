AR atom visualizer created in Unity with Vuforia SDK

Visualize all the elements of the periodic table by means of a small image, revealing their protons, neutrons and electrons in their respective layers. Made in Unity (C#), optimising the objects so that they can be seen in a decent way on a mobile.
